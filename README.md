Proof-of-concept VuePress documentation site built locally and hosted in GitHub Pages


## About

This repo is an experiment with other tools and resources for documentation, related to [@LibreCorps](https://github.com/librecorps "LibreCorps on GitHub.com").
VuePress is a documentation site that shows potential for open hardware projects, or open projects where the final deliverable of a project is not necessarily stored in "source".
To experiment, this repository is intended to be live experimentation site for me to try out VuePress and quickly see changes deployed in a GitHub Pages site.
